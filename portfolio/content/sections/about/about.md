I thrive in the hidden realms of software, where databases hum quietly, APIs connect seamlessly, and server logic weaves its magic behind the scenes. With a keen eye for detail, a relentless pursuit of efficiency, and a passion for security, I'm driven to craft robust and scalable backend solutions that power the digital experiences we rely on every day.

Given my privilege and technical skills, my mission is to create innovative and elegant solutions to problems of marginalized communities, striving to make an impact with my code.
